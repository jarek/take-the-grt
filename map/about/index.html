<h2>about</h2>

<p>This map is a relatively simple overlay of GRT's 
system map over Google's mapping technology.
It was created as <a href="http://www.grt.ca/web/transit.nsf/vwArticles/TE-GR-ROU-ART-1000f?OpenDocument">the system maps made available by the GRT</a> are huge 
PDFs ill-suited to being opened by anything but a recent desktop computer.</p>

<p>The GRT map overlay tiles were created by Hassaan A. of <a href="http://www.och.uwaterloo.ca/index.html">UW Off-Campus Housing</a> for use on OCH's 
housing search page. However, the map as presented on OCH sites
is very small, useful only for locating bus routes nearby to an address.</p>

<p>We've requested 
permission to reuse them, but never received a final all-clear. 
We've decided to go ahead and construct a full-screen map that can be 
used to review the system as a whole as opposed to checking routes near 
a single address.
To avoid freeloading, we are hosting our data on our own server.
Take the GRT is non-profit and 100% volunteer-driven, and we hope 
this will be a valuable service; however, we are prepared to cease using 
OCH's work if required.</p>

<h2 id="errata">known issues</h2>

<p>This live map, as well as the rendered files made available for download,
were created from the 2008 edition of the map. 
They are largely true to the <a href="http://www.grt.ca/web/transit.nsf/vwArticles/TE-GR-ROU-ART-1000f?OpenDocument">2010 maps</a>, with the following exceptions:</p>

<ul>

<li>in northern Waterloo, route 14's routing via Frobisher Dr, Bridge St, 
and Bathurst Dr, marked as "evenings and sundays only" on the interactive map, 
no longer exists on the official 2010 map.
See <a href="http://www.grt.ca/web/transit.nsf/vwArticles/38FAFF3E71C3B074852573370065C4B1/$file/Rt14_Sept07_09.pdf?openelement">route 14 routing and schedule</a>
on the GRT website (PDF, 590 kB).</li>

<li>in southern Kitchener, routes 26 and 33 have been amalgated into a single route 33 
which travels through Huron Business Park on the old route 26 routing 
southbound (away from Forest Glen) in the mornings 
and northbound (towards Forest Glen) in the afternoons.
