14:41	qviri	ok I think we're good
	qviri	go to http://192.237.29.245/HastinfoWeb/StartTimetableForm.aspx
	qviri	today (feb 21) is saturday schedule, tomorrow (22) is sunday schedule obv
14:42	qviri	route of interest is 12 both ways, first one is to Kitchener (you can't see while selecting, gg), second one is to Waterloo
14:43	qviri	look at departure times for every stop from 3148 keats/candlewood to as far as you feel like up to 2785 university/king (this is for waterloo bound)
	[username]	Just need me to scrape all this info?
	[username]	what format? just in an excel doc ok?
	qviri	for kitchener bound it's 3621 uni/king to 3161 keats/candlewood
	qviri	sec
14:44	qviri	http://takethegrt.ca/manual/tempTripInsert.php is my fancy insert form
	qviri	takes stop number as integer (what grt defines it as, so 3161 or whatever
	qviri	trip number which I'll tell you shortly
14:45	qviri	and stop times which is just copied out of the hastinfo schedule. don't copy the first value because that's the previous day's last trip. 
	qviri	after that, it looks like 
	qviri	7:15 AM[V]
	qviri	7:45 AM[V]
	qviri	8:15 AM[V]
	qviri	and just feed this into the form, all of the day's times for each stop at the same time
14:47	qviri	starting trips are: 176 for saturday kitchener bound; 109 for saturday waterloo bound; 236 for sunday kitchener bound; 211 for sunday waterloo bound
14:48	qviri	I think that's all, just go through the stops and copy pasta that shiz
	qviri	you should be able to see the saturday schedule on http://takethegrt.ca/keats/ as it goes up
	qviri	let me know if anything goes wrong and glhf?
14:49	[username]	alright, give me a bit, gotta brew up some tea and whatnot and then I'll see how this baby works
