basically everything was written by User:Qviri (Jarek Pi√≥rkowski),
except for some minor typo corrections by anon IPs,
and Tsyd's contributions:
- link to wrspgroup.fi in [Developers_App ideas.html]
- the three questions in [Talk - Design_GTFSOO.html]

there was also a load of spam that swelled our database to 10 MB, which was
annoying and why there's no better dump.
