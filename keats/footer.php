<p>These times are taken from GRT's data published on <a href="http://192.237.29.245/hastinfoweb/">EasyGO</a>. 
Standard precautions apply. Consider arriving at the stop early and
always allow a buffer if taking the GRT to time-sensitive appointments.</p>

<p>The data is unofficial, subject to change at any time and not guaranteed to be correct. All we promise is to do our best.

<h2>about</h2>

<p>This page is a basic proof-of-concept demonstration of some of the stuff <a href="http://takethegrt.ca/">Take the GRT</a> is working on. 
It is aimed at people who live along Keats&nbsp;Way and bus to the universities.
To keep things clean, not all stops along University&nbsp;Ave are listed in schedule of buses headed to the universities,
and not all stops along Keats&nbsp;Way are listed in schedule of buses headed towards Fischer-Hallman&nbsp;Rd.</p>

<p>The routes displayed are the 12 and the 29.
The table does not distinguish route 12 buses short-turning at King&nbsp;St. or Lincoln&nbsp;Rd.</p>

<p>We are working on much more functionality, including more stops and routes, customizable schedules,  
Google Maps integration, and data access APIs.
Visit <a href="http://takethegrt.ca/wiki/">our wiki</a> for more information or if you'd like to help.</p>
